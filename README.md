## Editing and Building the Documents

### Model

Only edit the most recent working draft, currently /model/wd2.  Only edit index-nametemplate.html and then follow these steps to build the final HTML document:

* Run `python ./rename_names.py` -- this adds the names to the use cases  
* Run `python ./extract_egs.py` -- this checks and extracts the examples
* Load `index-respec.html` in a browser and use respec to save as HTML5
* Move the resulting `index.html` into the directory
* In the directory, git add -A *

The final files for publication are:

* index.html
* examples/  
* images/
