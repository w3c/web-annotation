(to be sent to PlH, copy to chairs, w3t-comm, and the annotation group)

Philippe,

the Web Annotation WG would like to publish to Working Group Notes. The plan is to publish these alongside the planned publication of the Web Annotation Recommendations; the tentative publication dates has been set to the 21st of February. The two notes are:

Document Title:
	Selectors and States
Proposed Short Name:
	selectors-states
Proposed Final URL:
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-selectors-states-20170221/
Current Editor's draft:
	http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/selector-note/
Record of the Working Group's Decision (with 5 working days passed since):
	https://www.w3.org/2017/02/03-annotation-minutes.html#resolution03
Abstract:
	> Selecting part of a resource on the Web is an ubiquitous action. Over the years several selection techniques have been developed, usually in conjunction with the media type of the resource. Many of these approaches are also expressed in terms of a fragment identifiers [url], but that is not always the case.
	>
	>This document does not define any new approach to selection. Instead, it relies on existing techniques, providing a common model and syntax to express and possibly combine selections. The formal specification and the semantics originate from a separate Recommendation, namely the Web Annotation Data Model [annotation-model], where it is used to select targets of annotations. The current document only “extracts” Selectors and States from that data model; by doing so, it makes their usage easier for applications developers whose concerns are not related to annotations.

Document Title:
 	Embedding Web Annotations in HTML
Proposed Short Name:
	annotation-html
Proposed Final URL:
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-annotation-html-20170221/
Current Editor's draft:
	http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/serialization-html-note/
Record of the Working Group's Decision (with 5 working days passed since):
	https://www.w3.org/2017/02/03-annotation-minutes.html#resolution04
Abstract:
	> The Web Annotation Working Group has published three Recommendations for expressing annotations on the Web: the Web Annotation Data Model [annotation-model]; the Web Annotation Vocabulary [annotation-vocab]; and the Web Annotation Protocol [annotation-protocol]. These Recommendations define a serialization of the Model in a new, Web annotation-specific profile of JSON-LD [json-ld].
	>
	> This Note describes and illustrates potential approaches for including annotations within HTML documents. Examples also are included illustrating the use within an HTML document of annotation Selectors as fragment identifiers. (The Working Group's Selectors and States Reference Note [selectors-states] defines the syntax used for Selectors as fragment identifiers.)
	>
	> The approaches described in this document are incomplete and preliminary. They do not exhaust the full range of feasible options. The approaches discussed in this note have emerged from Working Group discussions and should be considered no more than initial starting points for further discussion, experimentation and development.

Can we get your approval?

Thanks

Ivan
