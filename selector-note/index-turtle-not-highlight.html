        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Selecting <em>part of</em> a resource on the Web is an ubiquitous action. Interactive editing of a resources, highlighting an area on the screen, adding an annotation to a specific point in a resource, or using a section of a larger dataset for visualization are all examples that involve selection within a resource. Over the years several selection techniques have been developed, usually in conjunction with the media type of the resource. These include referring to a unique identifier within a resource, defining a time interval for an audio or video track, identifying an element within the DOM tree for an XML source, or using CSS style elements to locate content. Many of these approaches are also expressed in terms of a <em>fragment identifiers</em>&nbsp;[[url]], but that is not always the case.</p>

            <p>This document does not define any new approach to selection. Instead, it relies on existing techniques, providing a <em>common model and syntax</em> to express selections. Furthermore, the model also includes a way to <em>combine</em> selections via refinements, a feature that may greatly improve the efficiency of applications relying on complex selections. Such a common model makes it easier to provide generic and interoperable tools and APIs to handle selections in various applications.</p>

            <p>A selection or state, as described in this document, may have its own unique identity in the form of an IRI. This IRI SHOULD be dereferencable and return the selection/state definition itself.</p>

            <p class="note">Using the IRI of the selection definition, instead of the reference to the “complete” resource could be seen as akin to a server side redirection, returning part of a resource.
            </p>

            <p>The data model is defined in [[json]], in the form of JSON objects and keys. The formal specification and the semantics of these originate from a larger model, namely the Web Annotation Data Model&nbsp;[[annotation-model]], where it is used to select targets of annotations. The current document only “extracts” <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> from that data model; by doing so, it makes their usage easier for applications developers whose concerns are not related to annotations. The only new feature in this document is the <a href="#frags">section on selector fragments</a>. Although this document is aimed to be self consistent, in case of inconsistencies or errors the&nbsp;[[annotation-model]] remains the authoritative source.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Relationships to RDF</h2>
                <p>The definitions in this documents also follow the extra syntactic rules of JSON-LD&nbsp;[[json-ld]]. This means that, through the usage of the JSON-LD Context defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/#json-ld-context">Appendix A</a> of the Web Annotation Vocabulary&nbsp;[[annotation-vocab]], also available online as <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld"><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld</code></a>, <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> can be seen as RDF Graphs&nbsp;[[rdf11-concepts]] that can be linked to, or used from within, other RDF graphs. Using the mapping defined in that Context <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> can be expressed in other RDF serializations like Turtle&nbsp;[[turtle]]. The formal specification of the corresponding vocabulary is provided by&nbsp;[[annotation-vocab]]. To make the equivalences easier for the reader, <a href="#exturtle"></a> contains all JSON-LD examples of this document serialized in Turtle, too.</p>

                <p>It must be noted that applications unrelated to RDF and/or Linked Data can safely ignore the context as well as the vocabulary mapping, and work exclusively with the JSON objects and keys as defined below.</p>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="IRI|IRIs">IRI</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>An <a>IRI</a>, or Internationalized Resource Identifier, is an extension to the URI specification to allow characters from Unicode, whereas URIs must be made up of a subset of ASCII characters. There is a mapping algorithm for translating between IRIs and the equivalent encoded URI form. IRIs are defined by [[rfc3987]].</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="Resource|Resources">Resource</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>An item of interest that MAY be identified by an <a>IRI</a>.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="Web Resource|Web Resources">Web Resource</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>A <a>Resource</a> that MUST be identified by an <a>IRI</a>, as described in the Web Architecture [[webarch]]. Web Resources MAY be dereferencable via their IRI.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="Specific Resource|SpecificResource">Specific Resource</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>A <a>Resource</a> that serves as a wrapper around the selection of part of another <a>Web Resource</a>. A Specific Resource identifies the relevant Web Resource (the <a>Source</a>) through a <code>source</code> term, and MAY contain other terms to refine the selection.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn>Source</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>The overall <a>Web Resource</a> whose selection is refined through the usage of <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> or <a data-lt="State">States</a>.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="segment">Segment (of Interest)</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>The part of the <a>Resource</a> that is selected using a Selector.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="External Web Resource|External Web Resources">External Web Resource</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>A <a>Web Resource</a> which is not part of the representation the selection, such as a web page, image, or video. External Web Resources are dereferencable from their <a>IRI</a>.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="Property|Properties">Property</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>A feature of a <a>Resource</a>, that often has a particular data type.  In the model sections, the term "Property" is used to refer to only those features which are <em>not</em> <a>Relationships</a> and instead have a literal value such as a string, integer, or date.  The valid values for a Property are thus any data type other than object, or an array containing members of that data type if more than one is allowed.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="Relationship|Relationships">Relationship</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>In the model sections, the term "Relationship" is used to distinguish those features that refer to other <a>Resources</a>, either by reference to the <a>Resource</a>'s <a>IRI</a> or by including a description of the <a>Resource</a> in the representation. The valid values for a Relationship are: a quoted string containing an IRI, an object that has the "id" property, or an array containing either of these if more than one is allowed.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="Class|Classes">Class</dfn></dt>
                  <dd><a>Resources</a> may be divided, conceptually, into groups called "classes"; members of a class are known as <a>Instances</a> of that class. Resources are associated with a particular class through <a>typing</a>. Classes are identified by <a>IRIs</a>, i.e., they are also <a>Web Resources</a> themselves.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="type|types|typing">Type</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>A special <a>Relationship</a> that associates an <a>Instance</a> of a class to the <a>Class</a> it belongs to.</dd>

                  <dt><dfn data-lt="Instance|Instances">Instance</dfn></dt>
                  <dd>An element of a group of <a>Resources</a> represented by a particular <a>Class</a>.</dd>

            <h3>Specific Resources</h3>
            <p>A <a>Specific Resource</a> serves as a wrapper around the selection of another <a>Web Resource</a>. This extra selection is done via <dfn data-lt="Specifiers|Specifier">Specifiers</dfn> that can be:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a>Selector</a>: Describe the desired segment of the source</li>
              <li><a>State</a>: Describe the desired representation of the source</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Specifiers MAY be External Web Resources with their own IRIs, such as in the example for the <a href="#selectors">Selector</a> construction, however it is RECOMMENDED that they be included in the representation to avoid requiring unnecessary network interactions to retrieve all of the information.</p>

            The use of this <a>Selector</a> does not require text to be copied from the <a>Source</a> document into the Annotation graph, unlike the Text Quote Selector, but is very brittle with regards to changes to the resource. Any edits or dynamically transcluded content may change the selection, and thus it is RECOMMENDED that a <a>State</a> be additionally used to help identify the correct representation.

            <p>An SvgSelector defines an area through the use of the Scalable Vector Graphics [[svg11]] standard.

            <p>Selections made by users may be extensive and/or cross over internal boundaries in the representation, making it difficult to construct a single selector that robustly describes the correct content.  A Range Selector can be used to identify the beginning and the end of the selection by using other Selectors.  In this way, two points can be accurately identified using the most appropriate selection mechanisms, and then linked together to form the selection.  The selection consists of everything from the beginning of the starting selector through to the beginning of the ending selector, but not including it.</p>

            <p><b>Example Use Case:</b> Yadira wants to comment on two adjacent cells in a table that is part of a web page.  She selects the two cells and her client constructs XPaths to the the first cell, and the cell that immediately follows the second. Her client then creates a Range Selector with the first XPath Selector as the start, and the second XPath selector as the end.</p>

            <p>It may be easier, more reliable or more accurate to specify the segment of interest of a resource as a selection of a selection, rather than as a selection of the complete resource.  Particularly for resources that contain other resources, such as various packaging formats, this also allows decomposition of the selection mechanisms when the components do not have unique identifiers.  This is accomplished by having selectors chained together, where each refines the results of the previous one.</p>

        <h3>States</h3>

        <p>A State describes the intended state of a resource when selected, and thus provides the information needed to retrieve the correct representation of that resource. Web resources change over time, and a State might be used to describe how to recover the intended previous version.  Web resources also have multiple formats, and a State might equally be used to describe how to retrieve that particular format.</p>

        <p>The state aspect of a <a>Web Resource</a> requires two distinct entities:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>the <a>IRI</a> of the overall resource; this is the same <a>Source</a> as used for Selectors (see <a href="#selectors"></a>). </li>
            <li>the identification for the state of the resource.</li>

        <p>A <dfn>State</dfn> object is used to describe how to determine the state of interest from within the <a>Source</a> resource. These two entities are encapsulated in a <a>Specific Resource</a>.</p>

            <h3>Request Header State</h3>

            <p>As there are potentially many representations that can be delivered from a resource with a single IRI, and a selection may only apply to one of them, it is important to be able to record the HTTP Request headers that need to be sent to retrieve the correct representation.  The HttpRequestState resource maintains a copy of the headers to be replayed when obtaining the representation. </p>

            <p><b>Example Use Case:</b> Carla retrieves a PDF representation of a web resource that can deliver HTML, PDF or plain text and then writes a description about it.  She signals that her description is only about the PDF representation.  Her client then includes a State to describe how to retrieve the target representation.</p>

            <div class="note">
            The representation retrieved from the server by the original annotator's client might not be completely determined by request headers alone.  For example, the IP address of the client might also determine the language of the representation, based on the language of the country the user was present in at the time.  If the server returns a <code>Content-Location</code> header, then the client might instead use it as the <code>target</code> of the Annotation, rather than the IRI that was requested.

            <h3>Refinement of State</h3>

          <p>Similar to the <a href="#SelectorRefinement_def">refinement of selection</a>, it may be easier, more reliable or more accurate to specify the appropriate state of the resource as a hierarchy of atomic <a>State</a> resources.  This is particularly appropriate for representing the combination of a <a>State</a> that reflects an internal transformation along with the results of a State that describes an external request. This decomposition is accomplished by having the states chained together in the same way as Selectors.</p>

          <p>Further, given that the State(s) will likely result in a specific representation, there may be specific <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> that are appropriate for describing the <a>segment</a> of the representation.  In order to accommodate this, States may also be refined by <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a>.</p>

          <p><b>Example Use Case:</b> Devina writes a comment about a travel e-book which has many versions available over time, and is available in different formats.  She is particularly commenting on a specific version and format, so her client adds both a TimeState to capture the time and an HttpRequestState to capture the format.</p>

        <h3>Selectors and States as Fragment Identifiers</h3>

        <p>Although <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> provide a flexible way of identifying, e.g., a suitable <a>Segment</a> of a Resource, the fact that this is defined through an indirection using a <a>Specific Resource</a> may be an obstacle for some applications. For example, many RDF tools rely on a <em>single</em> IRI to identify and dereference a given resource, and the extra indirection introduced by <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> would be considered to be a problem.
        </p>

        <p>To mitigate this issue, a mapping of <a data-lt="Selector">Selectors</a> and <a data-lt="State">States</a> on IRI fragments&nbsp;[[url]] is defined below. As a result of this mapping the targeted <a>Segment</a>, or the relevant state, is expressed in a single (albeit complex) IRI. In that IRI the <a>Selector</a>, respectively the <a>State</a>, is expressed as a single string and serves as a fragment combined with the IRI of the <a>Source</a>. Note that this representation is valid only if the IRI for the <a>Source</a> does not contain a fragment identifier of its own (an IRI may contain at most one fragment identification).</p>

        <p>
            The syntax for mapping a <a>Selector</a>, respectively a <a>State</a>, follows the same, “functional” syntax as used, for example, by the XPointer Framework&nbsp;[[xptr-framework]]:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The fragment uses the <code>selector(…)</code>, respectively the <code>state(…)</code>, functional syntax</li>
            <li>The (comma separated) “parameters” of the functional notation are:
                <ul>
                    <li>For the keys <code>refinedBy</code>, <code>startSelector</code>, and <code>endSelector</code> the syntax is <code>key=selector(…)</code>, respectively <code>key=state(…)</code> when appropriate, with the value following, recursively, the same syntax as the full fragment;</li>
                    <li>otherwise the key, and the corresponding value, follows the simple <code>key=value</code> syntax, e.g., <code>type=FragmentSelector</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			<li>For types and properties other than those specified in the Web Annotation model, the full IRI MUST be used.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>(see the examples below.)</p>

        <p>The values SHOULD be percent encoded&nbsp;[[rfc3986]]; the encoding is a MUST for characters that may make the fragment ambiguous, namely:</p>

        <!-- should be <table class="data"> but the stylesheet has issues.... -->
        <table >
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>character</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>code</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>space</td>
                    <td>%20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>=</code></td>
                    <td>%3D</td>

			<p>A fragment identifier is defined for a specific media type. This means that, formally, the fragment identifier syntax and semantics defined in this section should be registered for each media type separately by <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA</a>. Until such a registration is done, these fragment identifiers have the potential to conflict with other fragments possibly specified by the media type registrations.

			<h4>Serializing IRI to URL</h4>

			<p>Care should be taken that to make use of a Selectors and States IRIs as URLs (i.e., not only as identifiers but as locators), each segment of the IRI must be mapped to a corresponding URL segment following [[rfc3987]]. Applying percent encoding method for entire IRI string might also cause unnecessary troubles. Some examples:</p>

			<pre class="example nohighlight" title="Text Quote Selector in Japanese as an IRI and a URL, respectively">

        <h2>Correspondence Among Media Types and Selectors</h2>

        <p>Not all <a href="#selectors">Selectors</a> are relevant for all media types; some combinations are meaningless or not formally defined. An implementation may therefore ignore certain types of Selectors in case the corresponding media types are not handled by that particular implementation.</p>

        <p>The table below shows the correspondence among the main media types addressed in this specification and <a>Selector</a> types. The meaning of the table elements, and their effect on implementation conformance, is as follows.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A “✔︎” sign in the table means that the Selector type is relevant for that particular media types. A conforming implementation MUST implement that particular combination <em>if</em> it handles the corresponding media type.</li>

            <li>A “✘” sign in the table means that the Selector type is not relevant for that particular media types. Conforming implementations SHOULD ignore that particular combination.</li>

            <li>A “?” means that it is not possible to specify, in general, whether that particular combination is meaningful (e.g., fragment identifiers are defined for specific media types, i.e., specific text media types other than plain text may have fragments defined but they are not listed in the table). In other cases the usefulness of such combination is not clear (e.g., Data Position selectors for binary images). Conforming implementations MAY implement that particular combination.</li>
        </ul>
